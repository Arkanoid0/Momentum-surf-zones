Surf zones for Momentum mod (all .zon files)

On linear maps, stages are supposed to be checkpoints. Many of them are similar or identical to the KSF ones, but occasionally that was not possible due to different shapes of the zones or other problems that don't allow 100% accuracy.

To install just extract the .zon files into your /momentum/maps/ folder.
